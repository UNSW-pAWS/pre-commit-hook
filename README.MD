# Note

- The current script query from http://paws-backend.ap-southeast-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/threat/search. This maybe taken down hence please change line 18 in ```pre-commit.py``` from ```async with session.post('http://paws-backend.ap-southeast-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/threat/search',json={"package_manager_type" : "npm","package_list" : [package],"level": 0, "severity": ["CRITICAL"], "date": "None"}) as r:``` to

and ensure the backend located at https://github.com/UNSW-pAWS/webapp-backend is up and running before proceeding.

## How to set up your environment or project repo (as a project manager)

1. head to root of your folder type 
```
npm init
``` 
and fill in the information

2. type 
```
git init
``` 
to initialise a git repo

3. head to package.json and enter the following into scripts (assuming all the developers are using linux)
```
"preinstall": "git clone https://github.com/UNSW-pAWS/pre-commit-hook.git && chmod +x ./pre-commit-hook/setup.sh && bash ./pre-commit-hook/setup.sh"
```

# For developer use on a local environment

1. git clone your project repo

2. run 
```
npm i
``` 
(preinstall script will run and setup your pre-commit hook on developer's local enviroment)

The original package is able to work as it use pyinstaller to make pre-commit.py into an executable with all the dependency needed. As the change version of the file had not been compiled by pyinstaller we will have to give it a virtual enviroment to work within. Therefore, the following steps need to be undertaken.

1. `python3 -m venv [environment-name]`
2. `source [environment-name]/bin/activate`
3. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. `git init` if you did not have a git repo
5. `cp pre-commit.py .git/hooks/pre-commit`
6. `chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit`

Now you could create your package.json and test our product :)
